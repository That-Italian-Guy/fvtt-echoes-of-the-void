# Echoes of the-void
A repository for the Echo of the Void module for Foundry VTT

In "Echoes of the Void," the adventurers find themselves drawn into a village plagued by mysterious disappearances. As they investigate, they uncover a sinister peril involving interdimensional creatures from the Void. The source of these eldritch horrors is an abandoned tower ruin hidden within the nearby forest, where a forgotten relic weakens the veil between dimensions.

The adventurers must investigate the village and the surrounding countryside, piecing together clues to the nature of the threat and its source. Along the way, they encounter frightened villagers, haunted landscapes, and the lingering echoes of the Void's influence.

Their journey leads them to the abandoned tower ruin, where they confront not only the Void Invader and its Spawns but also the perilous artifact responsible for weakening the barriers between worlds. To save the village and restore the fabric of reality, the adventurers must defeat the creatures and neutralize the artifact.
